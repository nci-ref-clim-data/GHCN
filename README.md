# GHCN

## Overview

We have replicated the daily station precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN).
GHCN-Daily is an integrated database of daily climate summaries from land surface stations across the globe.
It is comprised of daily climate records from numerous sources that have been integrated and
subjected to a common suite of quality assurance reviews and
contains records from over 100,000 stations in 180 countries and territories.
This is an extract of the dataset description from the
[GHCN website](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily)
where you can find more information on this data.
We replicated only the precipitation daily station data organised "by_year".
This is an alternate form of the GHCN Daily dataset.
The period of record station files are parsed into yearly files that
contain all available GHCN Daily station data for that year 
plus a time of observation field (where available).
The original by_year files are updated daily to be in sync with updates to the GHCN Daily dataset,
but we are updating them on a weekly basis.

More details on how the data is organised and its status are available from the documentation files stored with the data.
For more information on methods and data quality assurance can be found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-methods).

## Data download

The data is downloaded from the NCDC NOAA ftp server:  
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn

The files are updated daily on the server. We update them once a week, the automated updates are managed via a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/GHCN/actions/workflows/ghcn.yml).

The script uses wget, to run: `./ghcn.sh`

A record of the updates is kept in `update_log.txt`.

## Data location

We've downloaded GHCN data to:
```
/g/data/jt48/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/ghcn/data/daily/by_year
```

The files are ascii format: `YYYY.csv`

The files format is described in `/g/data/jt48/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/ghcn/code/ghcn-daily-by_year-format.txt`
